*HOW TO SET-UP ANDROID STUDIO AND USE VERSION CONTROL FOR THIS PROJECT*
***********************************************************************
Go to the following link and download Android Studio (choose a directory you will rememember):
  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

After the download is done, you now have the Jetbrains IDE downloaded to create Android projects.
Boot up the program and wait, this sometimes takes a bit especially your first time running it. Once
it is open, at the top find the 'Tools' tab and then the 'Android Tab' within the tools menu. 
Run SDK manager. This loads up shows you a menu of available library downloads for APIs, Tools, and
Packages. You mainly want to make sure you have all the APIs up-to-date. So, go through and select APIs 
for Android 1.5 (API 3) to Android 5.0.1 (API 21) and download them. This is going to take a while, but
it is important to make sure you have all the libraries available to develop successfully. 

Once you are done updating, TO-BE-CONTINUED....
